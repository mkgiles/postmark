# postmark
An Android app for making posting easy and stress free

Keep track of your packages by adding their details to the app and have it synced with your account to check on any android device.

This app uses FirebaseUI and related APIs to implement Authentication and Realtime database.
Authentication is available through email and password, google account, and anonymous "burner" accounts.

You can filter packages by their postal service and search by name from the main page.
You can also view individual package's details and edit them after they have been added to your list of packages.
